CS 200 Project
Fall 2024 Implementation
Goals
This assignment will make you familiar with the object-oriented implementation of a complete
software. The grading scheme is as follows:
â€¢ Check the Project 4 rubric to learn more about the feature requirements and point
distribution.
Assignment
Given the requirement, analysis, and design you have performed for the Chocoholics
Anonymous (ChocAn) project, in this assignment, you will implement the system.
Task
Implement the software such that it supports the functionalities of all the use cases you have
identified in Java. Your class diagram must reflect the implementation. The functions to
implement are defined by the sequence diagrams. Make sure you have one public method per
sequence diagram. Use coding conventions you mutually agree with your team mates. Don't
forget to put comments in your code. Programming should be spread evenly among all team
members: each team member must be assigned nearly the same number of classes to
implement (remember to use documentation and knowledge transfer meetings for others to
understand your code). In the comment above each class, specify who the author of that class
is. Communication among you is very important, especially if your module is interacting with
someone else's. The code must be written using the Eclipse IDE which offers great support for
debugging. If you decide to use Visual Studio Code or any other editors/IDEs, you are
responsible for understanding the intricacies related to coding through them. Note that you are
not required to provide a graphical user interface. A command line menu issufficient; however,
a GUI is 5% bonus. Persisting the users/records etc. between sessions is another 5% bonus.
Submitting a program that does not compile will lead to an automatic -0- for the Java Source
Code score under release folder.
ALL TEAM MEMBERS SHOULD DO COMMITS TO THE TEAM REPOSITORY.
